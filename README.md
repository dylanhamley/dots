# The glorious dotfiles!
Here are some of the config files I have made/edited over the few months I have spent making this rice.
These files work for me, and I wanted to share them. I don't know if they will work for you, but they work for me. If I do anything with these files I will try and update them here, but no guarantees. If I change themes or change a major part of my rice, I will move the old config files into a folder so they are easy to find.

# How to install:
Replace your current config files with these ones. Make sure to make backups of your old files!

Locations for files:
zshrc - in your home directory
neofetch.conf - in ~/.config/neofetch
conky.conf - in ~/.config/conky
kitty.conf - in ~/.config/kitty

# Notes on neofetch.conf:
I renamed this file from config.conf to neofetch.conf to make it easier to see what the file is for. Make sure you rename it when you put it in its folder.

# Notes on zshrc:
I had to rename this file from .zshrc to zshrc or github would not let me upload it. Make sure you rename it to .zshrc when you put it in your home folder.

# Other stuff:
Feel free to use, distribute, or do anything with these config files.
